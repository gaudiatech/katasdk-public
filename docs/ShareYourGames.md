# Share your games

Our team is currently working on **an experimental feature**,
once finished it will will empower you or any game developer
to easily share and distribute your indie game based on "PYV"... With one single command!

In the near future, typing a special command will boost your creativity!


## The experimental command

Typing the command:
```
pyv-cli share myGame
```

...Will automatically convert your python game to a HTML5-based game,
upload your game to a server (*cloud storage*) automatically, and finally provide you with
a link that you can share with friends.

*Get feedback in matters of minutes! Not days, or weeks!*

The converted result may look like this:
<https://pyvm.kata.games/play/ecsRogue>

Or this:
<https://pyvm.kata.games/play/Breakout2> (made during one of our previous Pyved workshops!) 

!!! warning
    if you wish to test that experimental feature, you will need the latest STABLE
	version of `pyved-engine` that is: the `v24.9a1`, this revision can be downloaded
	via PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyved-engine/>

The goal is to share knowledge about game development and allow developers to easily **remix existing games**,
in order to improve the content shared by the community as a whole.
